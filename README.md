# What's that? 🍹
A Discord bot which will track invites 🍾

# How can I use it? 🏹
Everything to know how to use it is in the run file 🥂

# How does it works? 🍉
When someone joins, it uses the DiscordUtils Package to fetch the inviter & save it in `main.json` (as database) 🌊

# Is it working everytimes? 🚀
No, actually, there's some possibility to fail. Like if the user join with the vanity link, or these kind of thing. It doesn't work if the invite which was created was made for only 1 uses ✨

# Which packages was used? 📦
Actually, every packages are in requirements.txt. You can install it using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
